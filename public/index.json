[{"content":"Aamu.app database supports two APIs: you can submit data into a database via just standard html forms – this works just one direction – to add data into the database. Also, you can get and put data into the database via GraphQL.\nAs Wikipedia says it , \u0026ldquo;GraphQL is an open-source data query and manipulation language\u0026rdquo;. It\u0026rsquo;s a query language, and it has a syntax for reading and writing the database. For testing it out, it is helpful to have a tool. I like Altair .\nTo use Altair, or any similar tool, you first need to setup it with some information about your database; the database endpoint and the database API key. You can get the API key from the database settings. The database endpoint is this: https://api.aamu.app/api/v1/graphql/.\nAfter you have set those, there is the option to the get database schema. The schema will help you to query the database. In Altair the schema is called Docs. If you change the database structure, you can refresh the schema in the tool of your choice. In Altair, there is a refresh icon, which has a tooltip to Reload Docs.\nYou can browse around the schema. On the top, the schema has the following parts: Query and Mutation, which stand for reading and writing.\nQuerying the database Let\u0026rsquo;s see, what we have in Query. We see that there are some fields, which correspond to our sheets (or tables) in our database. I am using the aamu-blog as an example, and in the aamu-blog there are two sheets: Blog post and Person.\nFor each sheet there are two ways to query it: to get one specific row from it and to get multiple rows. Let\u0026rsquo;s go through each case.\nTo get a single row, in this case a blog post, you would query it through one of its unique fields. You can set the field as unique by editing the column properties in the database sheet. There is a checkmark that makes the column unique. For blog posts, the slug is marked as unique. Slug stands for \u0026ldquo;part of the url\u0026rdquo;:\nSo, you can get these blog posts by knowing its slug or by its ID. In practice, in this blog application, you would use the slug, as that is something that you know – the user will enter the url in the browser and that url will have the slug. So you use that slug the retrieve the correct blog post.\nHere is an example how you would query a single blog post (this particular one). In the parenthesis you would enter the unique field and in the braces you would enter the fields that the query should return for this particular item.\nquery { BlogPost (slug: \u0026#34;introduction-to-aamuapp-graphql\u0026#34;) { id created updated title slug description body publishDate status } } You can also get items by querying the field BlogPostCollection. This gives you from zero to multiple rows. You can also do filtering, sorting and pagination. In practice you probably will want to do at least filtering.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s see how the filtering goes. By clicking filter, you will get a list of fields by which you can filter. In practice you can filter by any field in the sheet.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s see how aamu-blog gets the blog posts for its main page. It will filter by status and sort by publishDate. Here is the query:\nquery { BlogPostCollection( filter: { status: { EQ: \u0026#34;published\u0026#34; } } sort: { publishDate: DESC } ) { title slug publishDate description } } You will notice that we have used EQ to filter for status. For retrieving single items through unique fields this isn\u0026rsquo;t needed, as the item is always retrieving by the exact same value, but for retrieving multiple items there are more possibilities. In Altair, you can get help by pressing Ctrl + space. Altair will give you a list of options how you can filter, like this:\nEQ stands for \u0026ldquo;equals\u0026rdquo;, GT stands for \u0026ldquo;greater than\u0026rdquo;, LT stands for \u0026ldquo;less than\u0026rdquo;, etc.\nFor sorting, you can get similar help. There are two ways to sort, ascending and descending:\nPagination is pretty straight forward. You would use it like this:\nquery { BlogPostCollection( filter: { status: { EQ: \u0026#34;published\u0026#34; } } sort: { publishDate: DESC } pagination: { limit: 10, skip: 20 } ) { title slug publishDate description } } That covers querying the database.\n","permalink":"https://aamu.app/blog/posts/introduction-to-aamuapp-graphql/","summary":"Aamu.app database supports two APIs: you can submit data into a database via just standard html forms – this works just one direction – to add data into the database.

Warning: a long explanation ahead.\nI’m Ilkka, a software developer/entrepreneur from Finland. My time is spent in coding, being in nature, and being a dad, all of which I greatly enjoy. I have another business. Embed.rocks , which is an API service and I have been running it for a few years now.\nTrust is an important issue in a tool like this. That trust will be built in time, and at the moment I can only say things. There are several reasons why you should trust this.\nFirst, as a software developer, I’m quite experienced, having been working in several companies in Finland and after those, on my own. That’s multiple decades.\nFrom the technical standpoint,I have tried to distance Aamu.app from the user’s data. That means that everything important is encrypted, server-side, with user\u0026rsquo;s own key (password). It means that even I, or anyone outside of that particular user/team cannot access that data. Meta-data, like timestamps and such, are not encrypted in a similar fashion, but mostly everything that the users are inputting by themselves, are. Some exceptions exist, which will be talked about later.\nThis server-side encryption also means, that if you, the user, lose your password, you cannot access your data after that. So you should really keep good care of your password, i.e. save it in a safe place! There is no “forgot password” feature at all!\nThe third reason why you should trust this tool is that there are really no costs of running this. The server hosting fees are small and easily covered by my other business. Besides the hosting fees there are no other costs. So, this will stay online as long as I am alive and well. There is a possibility that something happens to me, and then this service could go down. I will hire someone to help me with this as soon as I can, so even this will not be an issue in the future.\nYou, the user, can also download all your data at any point, so you can make backups and take the data with you as you wish.\nSo, what is Aamu.app anyway? It’s a productivity tool, but you knew that already. So, let’s get a little deeper.\nThe plan is to have everything that a company might need for its most important, daily productivity/office tasks, in a single package. Along that there should be collaboration integrated throughout tool. The user interface should be unified throughout. And of course everything should be easy to use.\nThat’s the plan and this is the start. Let’s see what we have so far.\nFeatures So, even though there are quite a lot of features, the combination shouldn’t feel overwhelming. This, like already said, the user interface will be unified.\nTasks Tasks are an important feature. Just about every company needs tasks.\nThe tasks have a few different views:\nlist kanban board calendar timeline Above, you can see the list, which is the standard view. Below there is the kanban board.\nHere we have the calendar, which looks and works just like Google Calendar. Oh, and there is also the Google Calendar synchronization – your events will do an automatic two-way with Google Calendar. And also with iOS calendar, should you have synchronization with that and Google Calendar, like most probably will. Helpdesk Helpdesk is also important and almost every company needs one. With helpdesk, you can handle customer support through what is called tickets. These tickets are currently created by email or by live chat (real time chat on your marketing website). In the future we may expand to handling customer support through social networks, but currently it’s just email and live chat,\nBy the way, at this point you may have noticed, that every main level feature looks and feels pretty much the same. This familiarity is important for the unified experience through our service.\nTo connect the helpdesk to an email account, you will need an IMAP connectivity, at the moment, We will improve this later so that IMAP isn’t needed.\nThe data (text) in tickets is encrypted – with the exception of titles. The titles are needed for creating email threads and titles are not encrypted.\nEmails You may start to see that all the features resemble each other quite a bit. That\u0026rsquo;s intentional — the same familiar user interface greets you everywhere in this app. No need to learn many things, just one and its variations.\nThe emails feature is what you would expect, emails – for all of your domains.\nDocuments Documents are like Google™ Docs, they may or may not be important for you. With this you can create all sorts of documents or ebooks (pdf). You can publish them for the world to see or you can keep them for your own use. In case it’s for your own use, everything is encrypted, but if it’s published, then it’s not encrypted – so you decide how secure you want them to be,\nThe data in the documents is totally secure – it’s encrypted with your team’s key. If you share the document with the world, then it is made plain text and unencrypted.\nDatabase Databases can be used for a lot of things and they can be easily connected to outside world. For example, I am using the database feature as a headless CMS for this very blog. I am currently writing this blog post in the database – you can see that in the picture above. You can also get the JavaScript sources for this blog on GitHub .\nDatabases can be used for blogs, contact forms, single page apps, e-commerce sites, CRMs (customer relations management) and so on. There is a GraphQL and forms API to connect your sites to the database. And of course we have a lot of templates to start with.\nAlso the data in the databases is encrypted, unless you choose them to not be. If you create an API key, then the data will become unencrypted – so you may use the GrahphQL feature, or API key, in only the databases where data security isn’t the top priority. At least for now.\nForms With the form build you can build forms. The data will go to the database (where you can see it separately and do all the things you can do with databases) and also the summary of the data (answers) will be shown to you.\nVideo Meetings Meetings,mean online, or video meetings, as is quite usual today. We are using Jitsi for this, which is well tested and secure video conferencing software, also open source.\nYou can invite participants to the meetings who are not users in Aamu.app , i.e. they are outside guests.\nNote: meeting names are not encrypted for technical reason (the notification system needs to “see” the names).\nDesigns We have integrated Penpot (https://penpot.app/ ) into Aamu.app. Penpot is like Figma, but Open Source!\nSecurity As you may have noticed, we have talked a bit on encryption. What this means in practice, is that all the important data (things you upload, data in tasks, databases, helpdesk, etc.) is encrypted with your team’s key and only your team can access that data. The encryption happens on the server, so this isn’t end-to-end encryption. But this is still a lot more secure than not encrypting the data, as then a hacker might get access to it.\nDon’t lose your password, though! As the data can be accessed only with your key (your password), only you and your team can access it. We don’t have access to your unencrypted data!\nPricing Some of you may wonder what’s with the price, which is $5/user/month, with the free option there as well. That seems kind of low, right? Yes, it kind of does.\nI have always, personally, looked for “good deals”, i.e. bought things as used and generally gone for things that offer good value for the price. This is prices similarly. I like if everybody can afford this and if this offers a good value. I understand that the price can “send a signal” but I have chosen not to worry about it. I believe (or hope) that people will notice the value of this service – in time.\nWhat about that name? Aamu means “morning” in Finnish. I think it’s also quite a beautiful name, aesthetically. And it comes early in the alphabetics. It’s simple and distinctive. And most people start working in the morning 😃.\nThat’s it! So, that’s it so far. There are perhaps some features missing that you might expect. For example email – currently you can use the helpdesk for basic email activity, but we will create a more complete email experience later (or, next, actually).\nTry it out and leave us feedback by clicking the email icon on the bottom of the screen. We would really appreciate the feedback.
