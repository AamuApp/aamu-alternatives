[{"content":" This time, let’s create a simple application, which uses just HTML, JavaScript and Aamu.app’s database through GraphQL. So, it’s what is known as a single-page application. The source code for this application (well, one HTML file with some JavaScript in it) is at GitHub. Using this in real lifeA small warning is in order: this uses the database API key, which gives write permissions to the database. So, using this on the public Internet like this is not advised. In those cases you should do the API access on the server side.\nYou can see the general principle here and maybe that will guide you enough into real applications.\nCreate the databaseFirst you need the database at Aamu.app. Conveniently, we have a template for it. You can create a database from the template in here:\nThe AppWe will create a sort of reservation calendar, which accepts entries consisting of a title and a date, and show the current entries as a list. It would look like this:\nThe list of entries is fetched from the database with GraphQL, for which you would need an API KEY, which you can create in the Database Settings.\nA new entry is submitted through the Forms endpoint, which you can also get in the Database Settings. We could also send the form data through GraphQL API, but using the forms endpoint is easy and enough for this application.\nBoth of these should be set in the HTML file, where is says like this:\n// Set these! const API_KEY = ''; const FORM_ENDPOINT = '';How the GraphQL part works here?So, when the HTML file is loaded into the browser, this happens:\nasync function getData() { try { const response = await fetch('https://api.aamu.app/api/v1/graphql/', { method: 'POST', headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json', 'Accept': 'application/json', 'x-api-key': API_KEY }, body: JSON.stringify({ query: ` { Sheet1Collection(sort: { startTime: DESC }) { id created_at updated_at title startTime } } `}) }); if (!response.ok) throw new Error(`HTTP error: ${response.status}`); const data = await response.json(); if (data?.errors) { data.errors.forEach(e =\u0026gt; setError(e.message)); } else if (data?.data) { handleData(data.data); } else { setError('No data returned from API'); } } catch (err) { console.log('Error:', err); } } // Get current data from the calendar (database) getData();So, getData() is called, which fetches the rows from the database (table Sheet1) and then presents the data on the screen (function handleData).\nNote that you can do GraphQL queries very easily, using the Fetch API. You can read more about the syntax of the GraphQL queries here in our blog.\nSending the dataAs told, sending happens through the Forms API. Sharing the Forms API endpoint is safe — it can be used only for adding data. That’s it!There’s not much more to it: just fetching data from a database and adding data to a database, while showing it on a screen. This was a really simple application.\n","permalink":"https://aamu.app/blog/posts/creating-a-single-page-application-with-aamuapps-database-and-graphql-api/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThis time, let’s create a simple application, which uses just HTML, JavaScript and Aamu.app’s database through GraphQL.

Also you can get and put data into the database via GraphQL.\nAs Wikipedia says it:\nGraphQL is an open-source data query and manipulation language.\nIt has a syntax for reading and writing the database. For testing it out, it is helpful to have a tool. I like Altair.\nTo use Altair or any similar tool you first need to setup it with the database endpoint and the database API key. The database endpoint is:\nhttps://api.aamu.app/api/v1/graphql/You can get the API key from your database settings.\nQuerying the databaseLet's assume we are using the database aamu-blog, which is the actual database which holds the blog posts you are reading now! The database looks like this in Aamu.app (at this moment in time there are only two rows, i.e. posts):\nIt has two tables: \"Blog post\" and \"Person\". Our GraphQL API will have these fields for this database (you can use for example Altair GrapQL client to see the database schema):\nSo, the GraphQL API will create two fields for each table, one for fetching a single item (by an ID), e.g. BlogPost and one (BlogPostCollection) for fetching many items (by some criteria you define).\nLet's see how to get a single item. This is the query:\nquery { BlogPost (slug: \"introduction-to-aamuapp-graphql\") { id created updated title slug description body status } }When you do the query, you will get the data back (if it exists) as json:\n{ \"data\": { \"BlogPost\": { \"id\": \"3cfa30f8-ab29-459a-ad91-0651ae0b08ad\", \"created\": \"2021-10-19T19:11:49.257Z\", \"updated\": \"2024-03-09T07:38:23.916Z\", \"title\": \"Introduction to Aamu.app GraphQL\", \"slug\": \"introduction-to-aamuapp-graphql\", \"description\": \"How to use the database from a distance\", \"body\": \"Aamu.app database supports two APIs: one for submitting data into the database via standard html forms – this works just one direction. Also you can get and put data into the database via GraphQL. ... etcYou can also get items by querying the field BlogPostCollection. This gives you multiple rows. You can also do filtering, sorting and pagination.\nLet's see how getting multiple posts goes. Let's get all the blog posts that are published (status is \"published\") and the results will be sorted by creation date (older first):\nquery { BlogPostCollection( filter: { status: { EQ: \"published\" } } sort: { created: DESC } ) { title slug created description } }This will give the following results:\n{ \"data\": { \"BlogPostCollection\": [ { \"title\": \"Introduction to Aamu.app GraphQL\", \"slug\": \"introduction-to-aamuapp-graphql\", \"created\": \"2021-10-19T09:00:00.000Z\", \"description\": \"How to use the database from a distance\" }, { \"title\": \"Introduction to Aamu.app\", \"slug\": \"introduction-to-aamu-app\", \"created\": \"2021-10-10T09:00:00.000Z\", \"description\": \"Aamu.app is an all-in-one productivity tool\" } ] } }You can use other filtering methods, for example GT (Greater Than):\nquery { BlogPostCollection( filter: { status: { EQ: \"published\" } updated: { GT: updated: { GT: \"2022-01-04T02:15:37.975Z\" } } } ) { id created updated title slug description body heroImage { url } author { name } status tags } }This is the actual query which I'm using to create this blog you are reading. This will fetch all the updated blog posts since I ran this last time (since I built the blog last time). I'm using Hugo to create this blog, and the blog posts are in Aamu's datab, and I'm writing this using the Aamu's Documents feature.\nNote that there is a field called heroImage, which has a subfield url. You can find all the fields with Altair's Docs feature. It will fetch the database structure and you will see all the fields that you can query (or mutate).\nWith Altair you can also see what kind of filtering you can do. For example, Altair sees that the updated field is a date and will give you the following filtering options:\nYou can get that list by pressing Ctrl-Space.\nYou can also get similar lists in every spot in the query window – all the fields and filtering options will be easy to see.\nMutating the databaseHere we show at how we can mutate database rows.\nAt the moment you can mutate single objects, which are targeted with the id.\nHere we update a database row in our Person table. We will target the row that we want to change with the id field. In Aamu.app, the id field is a string, and you can find the correct id by first querying the persons, possibly with some criteria. Here is an example mutation query. It will change the title of the person and return some fields that we want to see about the person.\nmutation { Person(id: \"29940627-51e8-4fd0-82ab-d718ddfe802f\", title: \"Chief Procrastination Officer (CPO)\") { id created updated name bio title } }\n","permalink":"https://aamu.app/blog/posts/introduction-to-aamuapp-graphql/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAamu.app database supports two APIs: one for submitting data into the database via standard HTML forms – this works just one direction.

Too many apps, scattered chats, docs and tasks all over the place. Aamu.app is here to change that. It’s an all-in-one tool that brings everything your team needs into one spot, so you can stop juggling and start getting stuff done.\nWhat Makes It Cool? Here’s why Aamu.app feels like a breath of fresh air ⛅️ :\nAamu.app contains the most often used (by metric chosen by me) SaaS apps in one package. It’s got tasks tracking (with different views like a kanban board, a synced calendar), chats and posts, document editing, video calls, a helpdesk, emails, graphic design, a form builder and even databases. And what’s more — you can use many of these together — compounding their usefulness.\nIt makes collaboration between all of these apps easy. One unified user interface, and basically one app.\nWhether you’re a tiny crew or a bigger group, it’s built to cut down on the chaos of using a bunch of different tools.\nPlus, it saves you from paying for a million separate subscriptions.\n💡 Pro-tip: if you are doing some long-term work in a document, you can always open a new tab, so you don’t have to interrupt the work in any place.\nFeatures So, let’s take a closer look at the features.\nBut before that, let me say that all the features work by using the keyboard only—you rarely need to touch the mouse, unless you want to, of course.\nAnd on top of that, all features and all the data is real-time, and every user can edit everything at the same time — the data is automatically synced in real-time, and you will always see the up-to-date version of any data, anywhere.\nSo, those features I promised:\nTasks: Keep track of what needs doing with a kanban board, a list, a calendar or a timeline. There exists an appropriate view for every occasion.\nWork Together, Live: Edit documents as a team without the “which version is this?” confusion. It even has Penpot 2.x built in—a free design tool—so you don’t need something like Figma.\nTalk Without the Noise: Chat in groups, post updates, or hop on a video call with LiveKit. It’s all there, no extra apps required.\nHelpdesk: Got customers? The helpdesk handles live chats and emails, making it easy to stay on top of “tickets”.\nDatabases for Anything: Use them for customer tracking, a website, a blog or whatever you need. With GraphQL, you can get the data out (or put it in if you so wish).\nA Form Builder: collect data with a form and store it into the Database.\nCombine them: This blog that you are reading has been written with the Docs and stored in the Database — and then built into the real site (with open source tools).\nPricing We are innovative here as well—you can pay what you want. Or more appropriately, what you think this is worth for you and how much you can afford to pay. From 0 to as much as you want.\nWe want to test if this model works. It feels fair to us, hopefully it proves to work.\nWhat About That Name? Aamu means “morning” in Finnish. I think it’s also quite a beautiful name. And it comes early in the alphabetic. It’s simple and distinctive. And most people start working in the morning (not me). 😆\nShould You Trust This Tool? Absolutely! As the founder, I bring years of experience as an entrepreneur and programmer. My earlier venture, Embed.rocks , has been reliably serving paying customers since 2016, demonstrating our commitment to quality and trust.\nWhat’s more, there are no major costs involved in running Aamu.app, so it can’t really go bankrupt.\nAt the moment the service is run by one person only, so that’s the biggest risk—if something were to happen to me. When possible, I will take care of this issue too.\n","permalink":"https://aamu.app/blog/posts/introduction-to-aamu-app/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eWorking collaboratively can sometimes feel like a mess.
