      <description>&lt;p&gt;The modern digital workplace is a mosaic of specialized applications. Teams often find themselves subscribing to and jumping between Notion for documentation, Jira or Linear for issue tracking, Slack or Microsoft Teams for real-time communication, Calendly for scheduling, and a host of other tools for specific needs like design, forms, or customer support.
