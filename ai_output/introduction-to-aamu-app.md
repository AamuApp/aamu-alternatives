<p>Working collaboratively can sometimes feel like a mess. Too many apps, scattered chats, docs and tasks all over the place. Aamu.app is here to change that. It’s an all-in-one tool that brings everything your team needs into one spot, so you can stop juggling and start getting stuff done.</p><h2>What Makes It Cool?</h2><p>Here’s why Aamu.app feels like a breath of fresh air <span data-node="emoji" data-emoji="⛅️" data-annotation="sun behind cloud" style="user-select: text; font-family: &quot;Twemoji Mozilla&quot;, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;, &quot;Noto Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;EmojiOne Color&quot;, &quot;Android Emoji&quot;, sans-serif;"><img alt="sun behind cloud" style="display: none; width: 1em; height: 1em;"><span role="img" aria-label="sun behind cloud" style="display: inline-block;">⛅️</span></span> :</p><p>Aamu.app contains the most often used (by metric chosen by me) SaaS apps in one package. It’s got tasks tracking (with different views like a kanban board, a synced calendar), chats and posts, document editing, video calls, a helpdesk, emails, graphic design, a form builder and even databases. And what’s more — you can use many of these together — compounding their usefulness. </p><p>It makes collaboration between all of these apps easy. One unified user interface, and basically one app. </p><p>Whether you’re a tiny crew or a bigger group, it’s built to cut down on the chaos of using a bunch of different tools.  </p><p>Plus, it saves you from paying for a million separate subscriptions.</p><p><span data-node="emoji" data-emoji="💡" data-annotation="light bulb" style="user-select: text; font-family: &quot;Twemoji Mozilla&quot;, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;, &quot;Noto Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;EmojiOne Color&quot;, &quot;Android Emoji&quot;, sans-serif;"><img alt="light bulb" style="display: none; width: 1em; height: 1em;"><span role="img" aria-label="light bulb" style="display: inline-block;">💡</span></span> Pro-tip: if you are doing some long-term work in a document, you can always open a new tab, so you don’t have to interrupt the work in any place.</p><h2>Features</h2><p>So, let’s take a closer look at the features.</p><p>But before that, let me say that all the features work by using the keyboard only—you rarely need to touch the mouse, unless you want to, of course.</p><p>And on top of that, all features and all the data is real-time, and every user can edit everything at the same time — the data is automatically synced in real-time, and you will always see the up-to-date version of any data, anywhere.</p><p>So, those features I promised:</p><ul><li><p>Tasks: Keep track of what needs doing with a kanban board, a list or a calendar. There exists an appropriate view for every occasion. </p></li><li><p>Work Together, Live: Edit documents as a team without the “which version is this?” confusion. It even has Penpot 2.x built in—a free design tool—so you don’t need something like Figma.</p></li><li><p>Talk Without the Noise: Chat in groups, post updates, or hop on a video call with LiveKit. It’s all there, no extra apps required.</p></li><li><p>Helpdesk: Got customers? The helpdesk handles live chats and emails, making it easy to stay on top of “tickets”.</p></li><li><p>Databases for Anything: Use them for customer tracking, a website, a blog or whatever you need. With GraphQL, you can get the data out (or put it in if you so wish).</p></li><li><p>A Form Builder: collect data with a form and store it into the Database.</p></li><li><p>Combine them: This blog that you are reading has been written with the Docs and stored in the Database — and then built into the real site (with open source tools).</p></li></ul><h2>Pricing</h2><p>We are innovative here as well—you can pay what you want. Or more appropriately, what you think this is worth for you and how much you can afford to pay. From 0 to as much as you want. </p><p>We want to test if this model works. It feels fair to us, hopefully it proves to work.</p><h2>What About That Name?</h2><p>Aamu means “morning” in Finnish. I think it’s also quite a beautiful name. And it comes early in the alphabetic. It’s simple and distinctive. And most people start working in the morning (not me). <span data-node="emoji" data-emoji="😆" data-annotation="grinning squinting face" style="user-select: text; font-family: &quot;Twemoji Mozilla&quot;, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;, &quot;Noto Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;EmojiOne Color&quot;, &quot;Android Emoji&quot;, sans-serif;"><img alt="grinning squinting face" style="display: none; width: 1em; height: 1em;"><span role="img" aria-label="grinning squinting face" style="display: inline-block;">😆</span></span> </p><h2>Should You Trust This Tool?</h2><p>Absolutely! As the founder, I bring years of experience as an entrepreneur and programmer. My earlier venture, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="http://Embed.rocks">Embed.rocks</a>, has been reliably serving paying customers since 2016, demonstrating our commitment to quality and trust.</p><p>What’s more, there are no major costs involved in running Aamu.app, so it can’t really go bankrupt. </p><p>At the moment the service is run by one person only, so that’s the biggest risk—if something were to happen to me. When possible, I will take care of this issue too.</p><p></p><p></p>
