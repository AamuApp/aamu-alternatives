<p>Everywhere that you write <em>content</em> in Aamu.app, i.e. comments, tasks, docs etc., can can add <em>internal links</em> with the slash menu:</p><img src="9567158024223956_image.png" style="width: auto;" id="29421ff1-900e-41e9-a6f0-d7f048b315ec"><p>There you are presented with a dialog window, which has a search input box:</p><img src="1435869297912415_image.png" style="width: auto;" id="f6d27260-47a0-4bc6-867e-0cabbb0866ed"><p>Here my search term is “search for” and it is currently searching for tasks. I can search for any item types in Aamu.app. Switching between tabs can be done with a mouse (obviously), but also with the shortcut <code>Shift + left</code> and <code>Shift + right</code>.</p><p>When you click the item that you want to create a link to, this will be added to the document:</p><img src="6415156666543687_image.png" style="width: auto;" id="400092b6-6b18-4f5c-b818-e49d5aa616d2"><p>It will add a familiar box into the document/comment that you are currently writing. </p><p>Clicking the box will take you to that item. Pressing <code>Esc</code> will take you back.</p><p>This is how easy it is to reference other items in Aamu.app. You can link from everywhere to anywhere!</p><p></p>
