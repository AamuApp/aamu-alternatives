<p>How to create a blog with Aamu.app? Here is how I have done it for Aamu.app‚Äôs official blog at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://aamu.app/blog/">https://aamu.app/blog/</a>.</p><p>The ingredients of this blog are:</p><ul><li><p>A database at Aamu.app</p></li><li><p>For writing the blog posts: documents at Aamu.app</p></li><li><p>For creating the actual blog: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://gohugo.io/" id="3cc0064a-8cad-48d6-93df-8f6ff1fd33b7">Hugo</a> static site generator</p></li><li><p>A server (with a shell access) to host the blog</p></li><li><p>Git to publish the blog to the server (pushing the repo)</p></li><li><p>Nginx for serving the static site (git repo)</p></li></ul><p>You can also use some other method to host the blog, for example Netlify. With this method you don‚Äôt need a server nor git. </p><p>You can see the source code for the blog at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://github.com/AamuApp/aamu-blog">https://github.com/AamuApp/aamu-blog</a>.</p><h2>The recipe</h2><p>Here‚Äôs how it goes, from start to finish:</p><h3>Create a database</h3><p>Create a database at Aamu.app with the provided template <code>aamu-blog</code>:</p><img src="1746632279872_image.png" style="width: auto;" id="6a02906c-18cf-41b5-ab6e-2fce80636e12"><p>You would use this database as what is known as a ‚ÄúHeadless CMS‚Äù ‚Äî the data from the database can be retrieved from the Aamu.app‚Äôs GraphQL database API.</p><p>Inside the database you will see two tables: <code>Blog post</code> and <code>Person</code>. If you are not happy with the names, you can rename them. The table <code>Blog post</code> is for posts (<span data-node="emoji" data-emoji="üßê" data-annotation="face with monocle" style="user-select: text; font-family: &quot;Twemoji Mozilla&quot;, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;, &quot;Noto Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;EmojiOne Color&quot;, &quot;Android Emoji&quot;, sans-serif;"><img alt="face with monocle" style="display: none; width: 1em; height: 1em;"><span role="img" aria-label="face with monocle" style="display: inline-block;">üßê</span></span>) and <code>Person</code> is for post authors. </p><p>You should first create a row in <code>Person</code> which you can then link into your posts:</p><img src="1746632280246_image.png" style="width: auto;" id="5917a2b7-ec52-427e-8736-30eec3f0f1cb"><p>Then create a row into <code>Blog post</code> table and fill the data accordingly. <code>Body</code> field will contain the blog posts HTML code. You can write the blog posts with Docs feature at Aamu.app, which we will get to next.</p><p>Here‚Äôs a row for a blog post. ‚ÄúSlug‚Äù is the url component of the post.</p><img src="1746632280528_image.png" style="width: auto;" id="060b0e45-1182-4550-b4b6-5e61e7e5a840"><p>When you want to start writing the post, click the <code>Body</code> field of the row. You can write (copy-paste) HTML directly, or attach a Doc. Let‚Äôs attach a Doc:</p><img src="1746632280794_image.png" style="width: auto;" id="c661eb18-e621-42ce-8ff2-bdf677690af3"><p>This will get us to the next phase.</p><h3>Writing the blog post</h3><p>We will use the Docs feature to write the blog post (just as I‚Äôm doing now). </p><p>Writing a doc will automatically save the HTML code to the database‚Äôs <code>Body</code> field. So, writing the blog post is extremely easy.</p><p>You can also copy-paste the HTML to the <code>Body</code> field, if you want to write it with some other method.</p><p>When you are ready to publish the blog post, set the publishing date, author, possibly ‚ÄúHero‚Äù image and any tags you would want, and set the status to ‚ÄúPublished‚Äù.</p><img src="1746632281062_image.png" style="width: auto;" id="897251ed-bc94-4e2f-a80a-d6e86e1cda40"><h3>Creating the blog with Hugo</h3><p>Let‚Äôs create the actual blog now. </p><p>The idea goes like this:</p><ul><li><p>The build script retrieves blog posts from Aamu.app through the GraphQL API. The script knows the timestamp when it did this the last time (the timestamp is saved into a file) and only gets the updated/new blog posts.</p></li><li><p>The same script saves them into content files, as well as any images.</p></li><li><p>Hugo is run to convert the content files into a blog</p></li></ul><p>The source code, which we use for our blog, is at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://github.com/AamuApp/aamu-blog">https://github.com/AamuApp/aamu-blog</a>. You can use it as a starting point for your own blog, or just get ideas from it.</p><p>You would typically use a development machine to create the blog and then upload (possibly with git) into the hosting server. </p><p>You can also do all of this at a service like Netlify. If you want to use a service, they can usually be triggered to build the blog with a <em>build hook</em>. You can create such a build hook at your Aamu.app database‚Äôs settings: </p><img src="1746632281348_image.png" style="width: auto;" id="41324f84-1d74-4408-bd69-35ddd2b9a86b"><h3>Publishing the blog</h3><p>Still one thing to do: to actually publish the blog at the hosting server.</p><p>At the simplest, this can be done by uploading what Hugo created to the server. I have set up a git bare repo, with a <em>post-receive hook</em>, which handles the uploading part. Using git with a ‚Äúbare repo‚Äù is a handy way to do this, but a bit more complex.</p><h3>That‚Äôs It!</h3><p>Let us know if there was something that left you wondering - how could I improve this tutorial?
